# Ask Your Data
You are given a task - create an agent that allows you to ask questions about your data. 
Since we always try to narrow the task, let's focus the agent on analyzing only one domain. 
You can use any file that you would like, and I also provided here a financial report - I chose it because it is long and difficult to read, and I wanted you to see how well the agents you build deal with that. 

# Those are the things to accomplish
Ingest the data source you chose, such as the annual report. 
Then, create an agent whose purpose is to allow you to ask questions over this report. 
Then, make the agent answer questions that require reasoning, such as "What would you suggest the company do?". This sound trivial but it is not. 
Then, make sure the agent explains the information in that report as if you were 5 years old. 
Then, make the agent return a consistent output that can be used in other software processes. 
Then, handle the situation where the user has not uploaded anything.
