# Expert Agent
You are given a task - create an agent that is a law expert. 
Since we always try to narrow the task, let's focus the agent on securities law. 

# Those are the things to accomplish
* First, ingest Israel's securities laws.
* Then, create an agent whose purpose is to allow you to ask questions about securities law. Try to make the questions challenging.
* Then, find a way to force the agent to respond in Hebrew.
* Then, make the agent return a fixed output that can be used.
* Then, handle a situation where the user has not uploaded anything.
* Then, add a layer of complexity - provide the expert agent with a financial statement and the agent to return insights from the financial report. Use your imagination as to what insights are valuable - I made my agent to provide me with insights related to risks the comany might be facing.
